A CMS provides the basic infrastructure to build a website, which is useful for users who may not have the knowledge to build and code their own website from scratch. The WordPress CMS has many customization tools, such as an administrative dashboard with a user-friendly interface to create new web pages, add media, and more. For these reasons, WordPress is one of the most used CMS in the market today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different approaches to getting access to WordPress, but some setup processes are more complex than others. This tutorial is intended for those who desire to install and administer a WordPress instance on an unmanaged cloud server via the command line. Though this approach requires more steps than a ready-made WordPress installation, it offers administrators greater control over their WordPress environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tutorial will be using a LAMP (<strong>L<\/strong>inux,&nbsp;<strong>A<\/strong>pache,&nbsp;<strong>M<\/strong>ySQL, and&nbsp;<strong>P<\/strong>HP) stack, which is one option for a server architecture that supports WordPress by providing the Linux operating system, Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP programming language. We\u2019ll install and set up WordPress via LAMP on a Linux Ubuntu 22.04 server.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your needs and goals, you may find other options that are more suitable. As open-source software, WordPress can be freely downloaded and installed, but to be available on the web, you will likely need to purchase cloud infrastructure and a domain name. Continue following this guide if you are interested in working through the server-side installation and setup of a WordPress site.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":66,"template":"","acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/local.frictionaluniversity\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/professor\/58"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/local.frictionaluniversity\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/professor"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/local.frictionaluniversity\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/professor"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/local.frictionaluniversity\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/66"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/local.frictionaluniversity\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=58"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
